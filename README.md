# ft_printf @ 42

- I recreated my own printf function.
- My school doesn't allow us to use very powerful functions without knowing how they were created or thought out first.  
- The Usage on my ft_printf is the exact same usage as a normal printf.
- I also added my ft_printf to my all purpose [libft] (https://github.com/KlimRadostev/Libft)
